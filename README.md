# 4th day project is delayed

I decided to postpone the 4th day of the challenge until tomorrow of 4th Day because we don't have internet connection at that time hence can't access the information about the next challenge and its relevant learning materials. Worry not, I still complied with the challenge and finished the website in one day.

# 5th day project is incomplete :(

In short words, I failed to finish this in one day. A lot of mistakes happened and realized it until it's too late :(. Learned a lot with this project, especially my weakness so i'm still grateful encountering this challenge :). I'll try to complete this project in the future. The technology, IndexedDB, in this project seems beneficial to learn.
