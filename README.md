## Accessing the 3rd day project

The 3rd day project is heavily-reliant to APIs and blocked by CORS policy. To access the main functions of the website, your browser should unblock CORS policy to allow cross-origin sharing or the core functions of this website/project will not work otherwise

To unblock CORS policy, you may use Google chrome extensions like this one:

There are different ways to solve this problem. Suggestion above is one of the ways to solve this problem.

if you tried the extension above, please do disable the said extension after using the 3rd day project for security reasons.
